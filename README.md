we all worked towards an idea for making the process of learning, building and availability of satellite data easier for everyone for educational and research purposes. 

Our project name : SATMENTORS

It was a wonderful experience for us. 
Each of us prepared ideas and finally we chose one which was about making a single platform for streamlining the process of satellite data access and education. 

we hosted meets and brought together our ideas
Reworked on it along with  mentorship from our college  ' COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING TRIVANDRUM '
and submitted our proposal. 


Even though we didn't get shortlisted, it was a wonderful experience for me and my team. 

It was my first time participating in an international competition.
